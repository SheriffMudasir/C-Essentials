# C Language Refresher

Welcome to my C programming refresher repository! This repo contains various exercises, programs, and examples as I revisit and strengthen my understanding of C programming fundamentals.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my journey in refreshing my knowledge of the C language, covering core concepts, syntax, and practical programming tasks. This is a resource for both personal learning and for sharing insights with others interested in C programming.

## Contents

- **Basic Syntax**: Examples and exercises on variables, data types, operators, control structures (e.g., `if`, `switch`, `loops`).
- **Functions**: Usage of functions, function pointers, and inline functions.
- **Data Structures**: Exploration of arrays, pointers, structures, and other C-specific data structures.
- **Memory Management**: Working with `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`, and understanding dynamic memory management.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files, handling `stdio.h` library functions.
- **Advanced Topics**: Code demonstrating preprocessor directives, macros, and other advanced C language features.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the code examples, make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC). Hereâ€™s how you can compile and run an example file:

```bash
gcc example.c -o example
./example
